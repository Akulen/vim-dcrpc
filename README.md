# Discord Rich Presence for Vim

Because why not?

# Installation

Didn't try but *should* work with all plugin managers. Just install this like you install other plugins.

# Usage

To start:

```
:StartDcrpc
```

To stop:

```
:StopDcrpc
```

To automatically start the plugin everytime Vim is started, put this in your `.vimrc`:

```
let g:dcrpc_autostart = 1
```
